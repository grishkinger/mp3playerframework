# mp3playerframework
 - At the moment, I'm self teaching myself programming.
 - With every new language I cover the basics of,I'm building a small project to accompany it.
 - For Python, I wanted to begin with this simple mp3 player.
 - However, I will port this over to PyQT or a similarly more powerful widget-based platform, since this was easier to build then expected.
 ##Current Features
 - Super simple framework for an mp3 player. You can create your own using the same format.
 - Current features are:
    - Seeker Bar to select what part of the music you want to guide to.
    - Stop/Start Button
    - Browse Playlists (WIP, will integrate this into a GUI)
    - Volume Slider
    - Shuffle
    - Back/Forward Skip Options
    - Add/Delete songs from playlist folders at will
