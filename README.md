<h1>
mp3 player framework
</h1>
 <p>
  - At the moment, I'm self teaching myself programming. <br>
  - With every new language I cover the basics of,I'm building a small project to accompany it. <br>
  - For Python, I wanted to begin with this simple mp3 player. <br>
  - However, I will port this over to PyQT or a similarly more powerful widget-based platform, since this was easier to 
    build then expected.

  <h3>Super simple framework for an mp3 player. You can create your own using the same format.</h3>
  Current features are:
    <ul>
    <li>Seeker Bar to select what part of the music you want to guide to.</li>
    <li>Stop/Start Button</li>
    <li>Browse Playlists (GUI is WIP)</li>
    <li>Volume Slider</li>
    <li>Shuffle</li>
    <li>Back/Forward Skip Options</li>
    <li>Add/Delete songs from playlist folders at will</li>
    <li>(WIP) Add playlists from Spotify using Spotify Web URL</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
     <h3>TO BE ADDED:</h3>
    <ul>
     <li> Better GUI for playlist selector</li>
     <li> Easier customization (inbuilt commands to change the color</li>
     <li> With port over to PyQT, maybe inbuilt video previews for songs?</li>
    </ul>
